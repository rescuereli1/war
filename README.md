# War Card Game

A Python implementation of the classic War card game.

## Description

War is a simple card game typically played by two players. Each player receives half of a shuffled deck. Players simultaneously reveal the top card of their deck. The player with the higher card value wins both cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck. In case of a tie (war), each player places three cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher face-up card wins all the cards in play.

The game continues until one player has all 52 cards.

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python war_game.py
   ```

2. The game will automatically simulate a match between two players and display the results.
